00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:12.700
Hi there, welcome back, and well done for
completing your first graded assessment.

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.900
You're doing a great
job making it this far.

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.500
Chances are some topics we've covered
may have been a little tricky at times,

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
especially if you're
completely new to programming.

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.588
Don't worry if something
wasn't obvious right away.

7
00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:25.273
We went through a lot of new concepts and

8
00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:28.500
it might take several passes until
you feel comfortable with them.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.300
And that's totally normal.

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900
We all went through when we
were learning how to code.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.063
In the previous module we explored some
basic concepts, like programming and

12
00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:37.827
automation.

13
00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:41.325
We called out that each programming
language has a specific syntax,

14
00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:44.352
which we need to learn so
we can tell the computer what to do.

15
00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:48.808
We then got a sneak preview of some of
the things we could do with Python.

16
00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:53.316
Up next, we'll dive deeper into some
basic building blocks of Python syntax,

17
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:57.841
things like variables, expressions,
functions, and conditional blocks.

18
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.839
At first glance these pieces
may seem pretty simple, but

19
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.300
when we start to combine them
they become a lot more powerful.

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.640
Understanding of programming languages
syntax isn't too different from learning

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.685
a spoken language.

22
00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.859
For example, the best way to learn Spanish
is to visit a Spanish speaking country,

23
00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.733
immerse yourself in the culture,
listen to the people.

24
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.447
Then figure out how to arrange the words
to form a sentence that another speaker

25
00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:21.700
can understand.

26
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
The same is true for programming.

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.318
When you immerse yourself in Python
programming you'll learn how to formulate

28
00:01:27.318 --> 00:01:29.807
statements of code that
the computer can understand.

29
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:31.600
This is called syntax.

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.100
Okay, so as you go through the next few
videos keep in mind that our main goal is

31
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.000
to learn the language's syntax.

32
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
So we'll focus on how to tell
our computer what to do,

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.900
not on how to get it to
do complicated tasks.

34
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.700
Like before,

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.500
we'll run through some simple exercises
to help you see the concepts in action.

36
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.929
And as you pick up the new skills and get
to grips with different tools we'll start

37
00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.925
to write more advanced scripts that
tackle more challenging problems.

38
00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:02.215
Again, if at any point you feel confused
or that something just isn't clear,

39
00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:04.230
remember you can watch the videos and

40
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.400
take the practice quizzes
as many times as you need.

41
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400
The key to getting good at programming
is practice, practice and practice.

42
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.162
You have to keep working your programming
muscles in order to get strong,

43
00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:18.200
just like building muscles in the gym.

44
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.173
Train hard, train regularly, and

45
00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.608
you'll be tackling more weighty
coding problems in no time.

46
00:02:23.608 --> 00:02:26.051
All right, ready to jump back in?

47
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.678
In the next video we're going
to learn all about data types.

48
00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:31.300
Let's get started.
